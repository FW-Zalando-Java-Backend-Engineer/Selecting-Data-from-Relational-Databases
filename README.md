# üìò SQL Practice: Selecting Data from Relational Databases

Welcome! In this assignment you will practice writing **SELECT queries** in PostgreSQL.  
You'll use the [Crunchy Data Playground](https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground) to write and test your SQL.

---

## üéØ Goal

Practice selecting data using:
- SELECT
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- Aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT, SUM)
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- Subqueries
- Window functions

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Table Schema

We will work with an **employees** table:

| Column     | Type    | Example              |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| id         | SERIAL  | 1                    |
| name       | TEXT    | 'Alice'              |
| department | TEXT    | 'Engineering'        |
| salary     | NUMERIC | 70000.00             |

---

## üå± 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup: Create Table and Insert Data

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2.1 Create the Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL,
  salary NUMERIC NOT NULL
);
````

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2.2 Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
  ('Alice', 'HR', 55000),
  ('Bob', 'Engineering', 75000),
  ('Charlie', 'Engineering', 72000),
  ('Diana', 'Sales', 60000),
  ('Eve', 'HR', 58000),
  ('Frank', 'Sales', 64000),
  ('Grace', 'Engineering', 80000),
  ('Heidi', 'Marketing', 52000),
  ('Ivan', 'Marketing', 54000),
  ('Judy', 'HR', 50000);
```

## üß≠ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Practice Questions

Below are the **plain-English questions** for you to solve in SQL.

### ‚úÖ SELECT Basics

* 1Ô∏è‚É£ Show all data about all employees.
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Show only `name` and `salary` of all employees.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£ List all distinct department names.
* 4Ô∏è‚É£ Count all employees in the company.
* 5Ô∏è‚É£ Count employees in Engineering.

---

### ‚úÖ Filtering with WHERE

* 6Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees with salary greater than 60000.
* 7Ô∏è‚É£ List all employees in the Sales department.
* 8Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees in HR or Sales.
* 9Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees not in HR.
* üîü Find employees with salary between 50000 and 70000.
* 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ List employees whose names start with 'A'.

---

### ‚úÖ Sorting with ORDER BY

* 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Show all employees sorted by salary (lowest to highest).
* 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Show all employees sorted by salary (highest to lowest).
* 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Show all employees sorted by department and then salary descending.
* 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Show the top 3 highest-paid employees.

---

### ‚úÖ Aggregates (AVG, SUM, COUNT)

* 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average salary of all employees?
* 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the total of all salaries?
* 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ How many employees are in each department?
* 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average salary per department?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ What is the highest salary per department?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the lowest salary per department?

---

### ‚úÖ GROUP BY + HAVING

* 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Which departments have more than 2 employees?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Which departments have an average salary above 60000?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Which departments have a total salary cost above 150000?

---

### ‚úÖ Subqueries

* 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Which employees have a salary above the overall average?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Which employees earn above their department average?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Which departments have at least one employee with salary over 80000?
* 2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Find the top earner in each department. *(Hint: this may need multiple queries)*

---

### ‚úÖ Window Functions

* 2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees with their rank within their department based on salary.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees with their dense rank within department based on salary.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees with a running total of salary ordered by salary.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ For each employee, show the average salary in their department.

---

### ‚úÖ Challenge Queries

* 3Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Show Engineering employees who earn above the Engineering department average.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Show each employee along with the difference between their salary and the department average.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Show the top 2 earners in each department.
* 3Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Which department has the highest average salary?
* 3Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ List employees who have the same salary as someone in a different department.

---

## üí° 4Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Tips and Hints

‚úÖ Use `SELECT * FROM employees` to see all the data first.
‚úÖ Use `WHERE` to filter rows by conditions.
‚úÖ Use `ORDER BY salary DESC` to sort highest to lowest.
‚úÖ Use `DISTINCT` to get unique values.
‚úÖ Use aggregate functions like `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`.
‚úÖ Combine `GROUP BY` with aggregates to get stats per department.
‚úÖ Use `HAVING` to filter after grouping.
‚úÖ Use subqueries in `WHERE` clauses for comparisons.
‚úÖ Use window functions like `RANK()` OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...).
